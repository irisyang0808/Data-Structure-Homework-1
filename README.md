# Data-Structure-Homework-1

1. Write a C program, which provides four types of search: iterative binary search, recursive binary search, 
iterative sequential search, and recursive sequential search. Your program should also fulfill the 
following requirements:
 prompt for users to input how many numbers they want to generate (try to use memory allocation to 
dynamically allocate space for storing numbers as user’s request), then generate the corresponding 
random numbers as request
 sorting the number by selection sort or bubble sort algorithm
 prompt for users to input the number they looking for，user can input a number to continue search 
or press specific key to exit the program. The program should repeatedly execute until user press the 
specific key, i.e., choose to leave the program.
 User can input any number and choose any type of search function, these four types of search 
function should indicate the position of the search number if the number exists in the generated 
sequence or report not found if the number does not exist in the sequence.
